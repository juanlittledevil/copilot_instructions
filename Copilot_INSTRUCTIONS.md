## Workflow Guidelines

- **High-Level Planning:** Use GitHub for repo-wide planning, documentation, and generating/updating files. Session plans should give enough context for implementation (e.g., file names, class/method names).
- **Implementation:** Use your editor (VS Code, Xcode, etc.) for file-specific coding, debugging, and running code.
- **Context Switching:** If a task requires repo-wide context or plan review, advise switching to GitHub/web. For direct coding, focus on the local repo/files.

---

## Coding Preferences

- **Style:** Follow project-specific style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google C++ style guide, etc.).
- **Comments:** Add comments for complex logic or important design choices.
- **Structure:** Prefer breaking code into header and implementation files where applicable.

---

## Communication

- Be detailed and explicit with suggestions, changes, and code explanations.
- Always clarify ambiguous requests or instructions.

---

## Project-Specific Instructions

> **For project details, session plans, and documentation:**  
> Always check for a file named `/Planning/Copilot_project_instructions.md` (or similar) in the current repo.
> This file will contain project-specific goals, session status, references, and workflow tweaks.

---

## Notes

- These instructions are generic and should be referenced in all projects.
- Project-specific overrides live in `/Planning/Copilot_project_instructions.md` in each repo.
