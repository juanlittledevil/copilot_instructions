# Copilot Instructions

This repository provides shared and project-specific instructions to guide GitHub Copilotâ€™s behavior, coding standards, and workflows across all your projects.

## Purpose

- Centralize global Copilot instructions and coding preferences.
- Provide templates and overrides for project-specific guidance.
- Help contributors and Copilot maintain consistent style, structure, and workflow.

## Key Files

- **Copilot_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Global Copilot behavior, coding standards, naming conventions, and workflow guidelines.
- **Copilot_project_instructions_emplate.md**: Template for creating project-specific overrides and guidance.

## Usage

- Reference `Copilot_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for general coding and workflow rules.
- Use `Copilot_project_instructions_emplate.md` to create `/Planning/Copilot_project_instructions.md` in each project for customizations.
- Update these files as your preferences or workflows evolve.

## Notes

- Project-specific instructions take precedence over global settings when provided.
- For planning and architecture, use files in a `/Planning/` directory as described in the template.
